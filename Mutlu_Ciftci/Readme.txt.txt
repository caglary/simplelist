My name is Çaglar , from Turkey. This is my first project is coded with c# programming. i want to save some information of farmer. 
i need like this program for Save, Delete and Update commit. 
but you must download sql server to your pc. and use it .

i use visual studio 2017 . my first programme is c#. now i want to python. i think python is flexible.
For Example , if you want to save of some information, i dont need use sql server. i can manage of my data without any server .
